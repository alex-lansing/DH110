In this project, I plan to analyze the user experience of the LiteNote website (https://www.lightnote.co/). This website invites users to learn music theory through interactive activities and educative visualizations. Topics include Sound Waves, Harmony, Scales, Chords, Keys, and Diatonic Chords. I am interesting in analyzing this site because I have studied music theory myself, and I feel this site provides a user experience that is effective for those hoping to study music theory. I plan to further analyze the Usability Heurisics of the site, including user control and freedom, recognition quality, and user help availability. I hope to find what adds to the usability of this site, and further, what improvements could be made to create a better user experience.
