# High-Fidelity Prototype

## Assignment 7: UX Interactive Prototype
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description
This portion of my project is creating a working prototype of my music-learning app design. The purpose of high-fidelity prototyping is to demonstrate the graphic design and interactivity of an application. I used Figma to create my prototype while following my prior-created wireframes and wireflow. 

The following prototype illustrates 7 main tasks:
1. Complete the music experience placement quiz to start on a suggested lesson
2. View personal progress and completed lessons
3. View user profile to see posts and achievements
4. Access TuneMate Connect, join a group chat
5. Comment on other user posts in TuneMate Connect
6. View other user profiles
7. Direct message other users

## Cognitive Walkthrough
After completing the first draft of my prototype, I recieved feedback from other UX students in the DH110 course. Feedback about my prototype was recorded through Google Forms, and can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1De325Z9QuXnAkKbLBi8ejk8dKOU9v8-tDfxbD_bGsUg/edit?usp=sharing).

### Findings Summary
| Feature | Feedback | Reflection |
|---|---|---|
| Color Scheme | "I like the blue theme, it makes it feel academic but still fun." | This feedback was encouraging because the blue color scheme I chose was meant to make the app look academic and fun. |
| Lesson Activity | "A 'next' button after the lesson would be helpful." | This is an important feature to consider when more lesson content is developed. Users should have a next button (towards the bottom right of the page) to move through lesson content.  |
| Lesson Menu | "I'm used to all lessons being on one page." | This feedback is good to note. However, the layout of the application would be much more complicated/confusing if users were required to scroll to access all lesson topics. Perhaps the menu bar could be organized in a way that is more clear to users. |
| Overall Design | "Looks legit and professional." | This was an encouraging comment because I hoped for the design to present a professional aesthetic. |

My peers gave valuable feedback on the TuneMate prototype. The comment that stood out most was that a "next" button should be added to lesson activity pages. I definitely plan to add this feature as I continue to develop my prototype. If I were to conduct a cognitive walkthrough again, I would survey more individuals, and ask more in-depth questions. This in-class cognitive walkthrough did not provide as much insight as I would have hoped due to limited time and participants. Thus I decided to conduct a Usability Test for deeper insight.
