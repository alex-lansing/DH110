# High-Fidelity Prototype

## Assignment 7: UX Interactive Prototype
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description
This portion of my project is creating a working prototype of my music-learning app design. The purpose of high-fidelity prototyping is to demonstrate the graphic design and interactivity of an application. I used Figma to create my prototype while following my prior-created wireframes and wireflow. 

The following prototype illustrates 7 main tasks:
1. Complete the music experience placement quiz to start on a suggested lesson
2. View personal progress and completed lessons
3. View user profile to see posts and achievements
4. Access TuneMate Connect, join a group chat
5. Comment on other user posts in TuneMate Connect
6. View other user profiles
7. Direct message other users
