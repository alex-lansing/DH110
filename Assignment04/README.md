## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows creators and designers to consider the perspectives of different users. Storytelling highlights the context behind why and how a user interacts with a product. This is important for designing an interface and for usability testing because it can bring forward potential issues of a product, and inspires improvements that appeal to a broader span of users.

According to [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/scenarios.html), the top things to consider when writing scenarios are:
1. Who is the User? : Focus on the main user group interacting with the product
2. Why does the user interact with the product? : Consider what draws users to the product and their expectations of the product
3. What goals does the user have? : Understand what the user wants in a product and how you can integrate these wants/needs in the overall design
4. How can the user achieve their goals on the site? : Identify what will satisfy users and what will frustrate users in a product to eliminate potential barriers in the design
