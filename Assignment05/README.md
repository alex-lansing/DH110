## Project Description
This project aims to improve the music learning process through a simple application. Based on my prior Usability Testing, Qualitatative User Research, and User Scenarios, I have made note of features that users need and desire in a digital music-learning platform. During the Usability Testing, I investigated the features of a pre-existing application called [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) by Abelton.com. In this study, I found that my subject was satisfied by the simplicity of the learning activities. The buttons were clearly indicated and there were clear directions and further help provided for each activity. The main issue found in this study was that the menu bar was difficult to find at first, because the menu icon/placement was not familiar to the user. In my Qualitative Research study, I observed how a subject utilizes their chosen digital tools to assist in music learning. Through my observations, I found that the user desires an application that provides a broad set of learning material that is tailored to his prior experience. The main issue that this subject noted was that he has difficulty finding other musicians nearby to practice with.

From these research studies, I decided to focus on improving the main issues found in current music-learning applications. The first improvement would be to create an application that is easily navigable and tailored to the user's experience level. This would involve creating a simple menu bar with an overview of clear lesson plans, and a placement quiz that suggests which lesson users should start with based on their experience level. The second improvement would be to create an application that connects music-learning users with others nearby via a social connection platform. This would involve a social chat feature where users are able to find others in the area by joining local group chats.

These improvements inspired two User Scenarios. The first scenario involved a busy hobbyist, who had some prior music experience, and wanted to learn more about music. Due to their lack of time, the hobbyist utilized a "Placement Quiz" feature to help them efficiently begin lessons based on their prior experience. The hobbyist was also able to navigate efficiently to other lessons through the Menu when they wanted to skip around lesson topics. The second scenario involved a social guitarist, who wanted to connect with other musicians nearby to practice playing with others. This guitarist utilized the social connection feature in the application to find local musicians that wanted to practice together. The guitarist searched through a local group chat, and reached out to another musician via direct message / commenting.

With research and user scenarios completed, this current project now focuses on developing a low-fidelity prototype that integrates each feature noted to improve the music-learning application.
