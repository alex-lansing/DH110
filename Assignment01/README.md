# Music Learning through Online Lesson Platforms
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

As our world becomes increasingly influenced by media and tech, much education has shifted online. The internet provides numerous resources for learning skills that would otherwise be taught in school or other in-person locations. As a pianist, I grew up learning music theory from a teacher at home. Our music lessons involved tangible, off-line materials including paperback theory books and piano keys. But with the growing popularity of educational websites, people can learn music theory with the click of a mouse. Further, music has become an art made not only through instruments, but digital tools. In this project, I plan to analyze the music theory learning site, [LightNote](https://www.lightnote.co/), and the digital music making site, [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html), to see how modern websites educate users about music. I will explore the different aspects of each site that contribute to their overall user experience. I hope to learn what adds to the usability and educative qualities of both sites, and further, identify improvements that should be made to create a better user experience. These findings will help direct my own project of a music learning platform constructued via the user experience process. I will incorporate UX properties that I find valuable and effective in my research, and avoid usability errors identified in my analyses.

### [10 Usability Heuristics](https://medium.muz.li/10-tips-on-how-to-conduct-a-perfect-heuristic-evaluation-ae5f8f4b3257) Overview
Heuristic Evaluation is a method that helps creators find usability problems in the design of a product. The 10 Usability Heuristics provide criteria for user-friendly experiences, thus helping designers identify potential problems in a design and directing the overall design process.

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Inform users what is going on throughout the design. Feedback should be given after user's actions and status of actions should be clearly visible.|
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Concepts, language, and visualizations should be familiar and logical to the user. |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to execute actions freely, even if errorful. Provide options to undo and redo tasks. |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Design should be consistent with other existing designs, and consistent throughout the entire product. |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Prevent possibility of errors throughout the design and provide users with ways to fix possible errors. |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Provide suggestions and visible options to minimize user's memory load. |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Create various ways for users to execute a task, providing broad accessibility for different users. |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Make user tasks as simple as possible by avoiding complicated designs and only including relevant features. |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | When a problem arises, clearly indicate the issue to users and provide suggestions for how to fix the problem. |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Provide further instructions that are accessible and understandable for users who need more help. |


### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-/) Overview
Severity Ratings are used to identify the most vital problems of a design. These ratings help evaluate products in terms of their usability and design. Higher ratings yield higher importance of an issue. The severity of a usability problem is measured with respect to the frequency in which the problem occurs, the impact of the problem, and the persistence of the problem.

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No usability problem at all |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
| 4 | Usability Catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released |

In this assignment, I will rate usability problems with severity ratings between 1-3 : Cosmetic Problem, Minor Usability Problem, or Major Usability Problem.

## Website 1: [LightNote](https://www.lightnote.co/)
### About
*LightNote provides interactive music theory lessons online through step-by-step chapters on seven fundamental topics. These topics include Sound Waves, Harmony, Pentatonic Scales, Chromatic Scales, Chords, Keys, and Diatonic Chords. Throughout each lesson, users are provided with visualizations of music concepts, buttons for interactivity, and text descriptions of each topic. To briefly analyze prior to the heuristic evaluation, I can see that the page is easy to navigate and the purpose of each button is clear to users. However, in some of the topics, the functionality of each button begins to be slightly confusing. Further, the site lacks further help options and information for handling technical difficulties. This site is accessible at https://www.lightnote.co/ .*

### Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of System Status | Most interactive tasks provided in each of the 7 lessons have an indication of what is occurring during the interaction. In the Harmony lesson, the sound wave interaction displays which wave form is currently displayed after selection. In the Diatonic Chords lesson, the chord-fitting questions clearly indicate what options have been selected, which selected answers were correct/incorrect, and the key's corresponding numbers change position as the user hovers above each selection. Throughout each task, users are mostly provided with visible feeback for their actions with visible responses that are understandable and logical. A possible issue that arises with visibility of system status is when sound is played by the user. When user clicks the "Play" buttons, there isn't indication of sound playing in every task. |**Severity Rating: 2** Minor changes should be made to indicate when sounds are being played by the user. No severe immediate changes need to be made to the site for status visibility. | Create a visual indication to users of when sounds are playing on the site. For example, when the user clicks the "Play" buttons, buttons should fade out while sound is playing to indicate status of the noise playing. |
| Match Between System and Real World | Icons and design is based off of general knowledge. "Play" buttons are designed appropriately with well-known "play" icons. Piano key visualizations are numbered logically with recognizable visualizations of the instrument and familiar labeling design. Toggles to increase or decrease wave height resemble toggles typically shown in digital designs that user can move up or down linearly. | **Severity Rating: 1** Design of interactions and tasks are recognizable and familiar to the user. | Minimal improvements needed in this area. The interactive tasks are labeled logically with recognizable icons and interactive components that users have seen in past experiences with other interactive sites, applications, or visualizations. |
| User Control and Freedom | User should have multiple options in interaction and be able to undo and redo actions. The interactions of this site allow users to play piano keys and lesson tasks repetitively. However, users are unable to undo their actions without refreshing the page. In the Diatonic Chords section, users must select chords that fit together, but selections are permanent. Users are unable to deselect their options or reset the question choices.| **Severity Rating: 3** There is limited flexibility and options for actions taken by user. No options to undo/reset/clear selections on tasks. | Add an undo or clear button where users are allowed to deselect their options. |
| Consistency and Standards | Design is consistent with other existing application designs, where sound play buttons are indicated with recognizeable play icons and interactive piano tasks are made up of familiar keyboard visualizations labeled logically in numerical order. Unclickable options are faded (lower opacity), similar to other existing applications. The numbered keys are consistent throughout the site, each key corresponding to the same number and color across all tasks. A potential issue here is that the Chord numbering looks like clickable buttons. | **Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic change needed for number icons under the chords. Users viewing these icons might mistake them for buttons since their design is consistent with other buttons on the page. | Change the numeric chord labels to numbers of different colors, rather than numbers highlighted by a dark circle. Avoiding the circle shape will limit confusion between button and unclickable icon. |
| Error Prevention | User is able to play other notes while demonstrations are running, thus disrupting the tasks. No options provided to restart the demonstration -- user can only restart demonstration after entire demonstration finishes. | **Severity Rating: 3** Users are easily able to disrupt the tasks and there is no option to restart musical demonstrations. | Prevent possibility of disrupting the music demonstrations by disabling the piano key buttons while demonstration is playing. Allow user to restart demonstration when desired by providing a "restart" button. |
| Recognition Rather than Recall | Lesson tasks provide clear options for user selection, minimizing user's memory load. Sound wave tasks offer 3 buttons that display corresponding visualizations upon clicking. The keyboard visualizations are labeled 1-12 throughout every lesson, reminding users of the number-key pairs in each task. Design could improve by including keyboard visualization in tasks that only have numbers, to remind the user what keys the numbers represent. | **Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic change could be made in the design of the Scale lesson, where users are shown only numbers. The number-only display causes users to recall the piano keys that correspond with the numbers. | Provide an additional visualization of the piano keys and their number pairs, or a written explanation of the numbers' correspondence with piano keys. |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Users are able to execute tasks in various ways. For instance, users are able to play all different types of chords, or click on piano keys individually. However, there are no options for shortcuts. Users are unable to toggle settings if they want to create their own chords. Chord playing is pre-set. | **Severity Rating: 2** Users have limited ability to customize the chords played. There are only pre-set chord options. No settings provided where users can toggle the ability to play their own chords or create shortcuts. | Make settings available where users are able to combine notes to form their own chords, even when chords do not sound correct. This would improve the flexibility of the tasks and expand accessibility for all users. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Design of the website is simple, and only relevant features are displayed. User options -- buttons and piano keys -- are clear and direct. Concise explanations are provided in each lesson, and brief descriptions of tasks are displayed only when necessary. | **Severity Rating: 1** | Little improvement needed in this area. Site displays a simple, minimalistic design with only relevant features and options displayed. |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors |  | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | When a problem arises, clearly indicate the issue to users and provide suggestions for how to fix the problem. |
| Help and Documentation | 10 | Help and Documentation | Provide further instructions that are accessible and understandable for users who need more help. |
