# Music Learning Through Online Platforms
## Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

## Introduction
[Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) is a website that invites users to learn about digital music creation through interactive lessons and activities. The site is organized into chapters with numerous sub-lessons. Chapter topics include beats, notes and scales, chords, basslines, melodies, song structure, and more advanced topics. The design of this website aims to simplify the learning process of digital music making. Unlike other popular music creation platforms, Learning Music presents a simplistic design and provides help and information about the various components of digital music. While the design is simple, there are a few features on this site that should be changed in order to improve overall usability. A heuristic evaluation has been previously conducted on this site to identify potential usability issues with higher or lower severity ratings. With the heuristic evaluation complete, I will now conduct a pilot usability test to further investigate the usability issues of the Learning Music website. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing
Usability Testing (UT) evaluates a product by testing respresentative users through observation and user feedback. UT helps identify potential issues in a product, thus directing improvements that will result in a more effective, efficient, and satisfactory product for users. In terms of usability, effectiveness refers to how accurate and complete users are able to achieve specified tasks. Efficiency refers to how fast and fluently users are able to execute a specified task. And satisfaction refers to the positive attitudes and comfortability users experience after using a product that may encourage users to use the product again. The goal of UT is to evaluate where a product might be lacking or successful in these (and many more) areas. In this current part of my project, I will utilize UT to investigate the usability of the Learning Music website. Although I have already completed a heuristic evaluation, UT will help uncover more global usability problems and allow for a deeper evaluation by observing a representative user of the site.

## Methodology
This pilot usability test will be conducted in a quiet office room located in my apartment. I will be using a Macbook Air laptop with a built-in camera to present the survey, capture participant actions, and record participant's comments/facial expressions. The study will be recorded via Zoom.

I, the moderator, and the user will sit adjacent to one another throughout the study. The user will recieve an introduction to the study purpose, and preliminary information about the test. The user will read and complete an informed consent form before completing the survey.
