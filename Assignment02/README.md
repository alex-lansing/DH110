# Music Learning Through Online Platforms
## Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

## Introduction
[Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) is a website that invites users to learn about digital music creation through interactive lessons and activities. The site is organized into chapters with numerous sub-lessons. Chapter topics include beats, notes and scales, chords, basslines, melodies, song structure, and more advanced topics. The design of this website aims to simplify the learning process of digital music making. Unlike other popular music creation platforms, Learning Music presents a simplistic design and provides help and information about the various components of digital music. While the design is simple, there are a few features on this site that should be changed in order to improve overall usability. A heuristic evaluation has been previously conducted on this site to identify potential usability issues with higher or lower severity ratings. With the heuristic evaluation complete, I will now conduct a pilot usability test to further investigate the usability issues of the Learning Music website. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing
Usability Testing (UT) evaluates a product by testing respresentative users through observation and user feedback. UT helps identify potential issues in a product in order to direct improvements that will result in a more effective, efficient, and satisfactory product for users.
