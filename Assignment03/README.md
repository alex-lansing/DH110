## Research Goal and Requirements

### Main Activity and Goals
This research portion of my project is aimed to investigate how users interact with music-making products to learn music. In this study, I hope to further understand how a pianist learns music through digital applications and the piano instrument. This study will provide insight for improvements needed in the design of online music-learning platforms.

### Basic Need Involved for Activity
The basic needs involved for this activity are esteem and cognitive needs. In regards to esteem, user needs a supported sense of self. This involves the feelings of competence, confidence, and freedom when interacting with the activity. In regards to cognitive needs, the user needs an encouragement for creativity, foresight, curiosity, and meaning. The user should be motivated to execute specified activities through creative and free exploration.

### Traditional/Current Solution(s) to Satisfy Needs
The current way to satisfy the need for esteem is providing users multiple ways to learn music. Many online platforms present different options for numerous learning methods. This includes diverse interactive activities, plenty of help/information options, and lesson plans made for musicians of different experience levels. These various options benefit user self-esteem by increasing their confidence and competence in activities, regardless of skill level. YouTube is one example that presents effective solutions to this need. It is an easily accessible online platform that presents numerous music lessons (of all different levels) on music theory, chord progressions, and specific songs.

The current way to satisfy the cognitive need is providing users with the freedom to be creative and explore music topics. Many online music learning platforms allow users to explore different combinations of sounds, beats, and musical instruments. Other platforms also challenge users to learn new instruments or music techniques. This helps boost users' need for creativity, curiosity, and search for meaning. The Learning Music website is one example that presents effective solutions to this need. It invites users to create their own combinations of musical sounds, and challenges users to learn more about the creation of digital music.

### Limitations

A current limitation of music learning platforms is the ability for musicians to play together. Learning to create music with other people becomes an issue when other musicians are not located nearby. There are many applications that allow people to connect virtually including FaceTime, Google Duo, and Zoom. But it is difficult for video-call platforms to replicate the true experience of musicians playing in a space all together.
