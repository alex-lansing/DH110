# Qualitative User Research (Contextual Inquiry)
## Assignment 3: Learning from People in Context

## Research Goal and Requirements

### Main Activity and Goals
This research portion of my project is aimed to investigate how users interact with music-making products to learn music. In this study, I hope to further understand how a pianist learns music through digital applications and the piano instrument. This study will provide insight for improvements needed in the design of online music-learning platforms.

### Basic Need Involved for Activity
The basic needs involved for this activity are esteem and cognitive needs. In regards to esteem, user needs a supported sense of self. This involves the feelings of competence, confidence, and freedom when interacting with the activity. In regards to cognitive needs, the user needs an encouragement for creativity, foresight, curiosity, and meaning. The user should be motivated to execute specified activities through creative and free exploration.

### Traditional/Current Solution(s) to Satisfy Needs
The current way to satisfy the need for esteem is providing users multiple ways to learn music. Many online platforms present different options for numerous learning methods. This includes diverse interactive activities, plenty of help/information options, and lesson plans made for musicians of different experience levels. These various options benefit user self-esteem by increasing their confidence and competence in activities, regardless of skill level. YouTube is one example that presents effective solutions to this need. It is an easily accessible online platform that presents numerous music lessons (of all different levels) on music theory, chord progressions, and specific songs.

The current way to satisfy the cognitive need is providing users with the freedom to be creative and explore music topics. Many online music learning platforms allow users to explore different combinations of sounds, beats, and musical instruments. Other platforms also challenge users to learn new instruments or music techniques. This helps boost users' need for creativity, curiosity, and search for meaning. The Learning Music website is one example that presents effective solutions to this need. It invites users to create their own combinations of musical sounds, and challenges users to learn more about the creation of digital music.

### Limitations
The current limitation of music learning platforms is the ability for musicians to play together. Learning to create music with other people becomes an issue when other musicians are not located nearby. There are many applications that allow people to connect virtually including FaceTime, Google Duo, and Zoom. But it is difficult for video-call platforms to replicate the true experience of musicians playing in a space all together. Music learning platforms could improve in this area by connecting nearby musicians, or by creating software that helps users practice with other instrumental accompaniment.

## Target User

### User Characteristics
- Demographics: middle-aged male, interest in learning music
- Preferences: some experience with music instrument(s), digital music technology, and/or music theory
- Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise for this study

### Context of User's Activity
- Online via digital music-learning platforms/software
- At home, school, or other institution where users can learn instrumental music-making
- Under the condition that users do not have access to instruments, they may prefer to learn music online through free and accessible websites. Users may want to learn music online if they are interested in digital music-making. They might also want to explore online information before purchasing an instrument. Under the condition that users do have access to instruments, they may prefer to learn music on their instrument through in-person lessons, or through online tutorials such as YouTube videos or informational websites. Users may want to learn music at home or school with an instrument because these places provide a more private space to practice, and also provide a learning environment if the user chooses to take in-person lessons.
- It is important to note that users may want to learn music *both* online and in-person, because there are several digital music-learning applications that also provide help for instrumetal musicians.

### User's Execution of Activity
- Through online platforms, users can learn music by completing interactive tasks. Interactive tasks would have users create combinations of music components to produce an overall song. These music learning applications often present a lesson plan that includes a wide range of topics. For digital music-making, these topics may include beat combinations, sound creation, rhythm, and chord progressions. For music theory, the topics might cover scales, chords, time signatures, and tempo. 
- Through instruments, users can learn music through in-person tasks. This involves learning notes and how to play the instrument. Users can learn these tasks through an in-person teacher or through online tutorials. Learning to play the instrument involves learning the motor skills needed, reading notes on sheet music, and understanding rhythms and time signatures.

## Methodology
- The observation method utilized in this study will be participatory observation. As the researcher, I will observe the typical activities of the participant while they execute their own music learning activities. The user will understand they are participating in a study, but the survey will be more discussion-based, rather than being fully led by the researcher.
- The study will be conducted in the user's music practice space. This is a quiet apartment room with a piano, located in Westwood, Los Angeles, CA.

### Overview of Study Survey
1. Introduction: Provide user with information about the study and brief details about what they will be doing
2. Background: Questions about user and user's experience with music and music learning. Further questions about tools and techniques used by user during music learning.
3. Activities: Four open-ended activities for user to demonstrate different ways they learn music
    - Demonstrate use of mobile applications to help with learning music
    - Demonstrate use of online websites to help with learning music
    - Demonstrate learning music without online programs
    - Demonstrate learning how to make music with other musicians or other instrumental accompaniment
5. Post-Activity Questions: Problems experienced with music learning, more details about music learning methods. Questions ask user about issues they have experienced with music learning and methods they have used to better their experience.
6. Wrap-Up: Further open-ended questions about user's ideas for better music learning products.
7. Closing: Thank the user for participating in the study.

## Observations
Below are noteable responses that may be beneficial for future research or design strategies:
| Video/Audio Time Mark | Heuristic Tested | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Find and Practice major triad chords | Recognition Rather than Recall, Match between System and Real World | User must navigate through the menu bar to a specified lesson, complete the lesson interaction, and identify where to check for solution. |
| 2. Listen to and edit drum beats | Consistency and Standards, Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | User must remember where to navigate to a different lesson, play the demonstration, and complete the lesson interaction. |
| 3. Create a second bar of drum beats and save work | User Control and Freedom, Error Prevention, Match between System and Real World | User must navigate to a new lesson, identify specified buttons and selections, and indentify how to save their work. |
| 4. Find further information about synthesizers and contact form | Help and Documentation | User must find further information about a specified topic. They must also find where to contact the company for any questions or comments. |
