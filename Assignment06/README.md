### Decision Process and Design Details
I decided to design the main "Lessons" page. I chose this frame because it captures the main page of lesson topics, along with the title and bottom bar options. The overall layout of this page includes a menu button, chat button, title of the application, title of the lesson, lesson buttons, and bottom app bar. For the main grid layout, I utilized 6 rows with 18px gutter and 32px margin, and 1 large column with 26px margin. To align the four bottom-bar buttons, I used 4 columns with 16px gutter and 16px margin. Lastly, for the items within the lesson-topic-buttons, I used 12 rows with 2px gutter to align the text and status bar in the vertical center of each button. Further, 24 columns with 6px gutter and 34px margin were used to align the items horizontally.

### Typography Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
For typography, I wanted a look that is fun yet professional. First, I tried using the Quicksand font because it has a young, fun appearance with the rounded corners and different boldness options. Second, I tested the Spectral font, which had a much more professional feel. After these two tests, I felt that Quicksand appeared slightly too disorganized/unprofessional, and Spectral appeared too formal. I researched more fonts through Google Fonts, and found that Roboto Slab was a happy medium of these two fonts. Using Roboto Slab for every text item on the application was a bit much, so I mixed in Roboto for subtitles, and used Playfair Display for the main app title. My final topography is shown at the very right in the image above. Details for these fonts are below.

| Text | Typeface | Font Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 (main title) | Playfair Display | 54px | Bold |
| H2 (lesson title) | Roboto Slab | 34px | Regular |
| H3 (lesson subtitle) | Roboto | 20px | Light Italic |
| H4 (button label) | Roboto Slab | 24px | Regular |
| H5 (status percent) | Roboto | 11px | Light |
