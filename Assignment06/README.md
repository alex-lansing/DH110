### Decision Process and Design Details
I decided to design the main "Lessons" page. I chose this frame because it captures the main page of lesson topics, along with the title and bottom bar options. The overall layout of this page includes a menu button, chat button, title of the application, title of the lesson, lesson buttons, and bottom app bar. For the main grid layout, I utilized 6 rows with 18px gutter and 32px margin, and 1 large column with 26px margin. To align the four bottom-bar buttons, I used 4 columns with 16px gutter and 16px margin. Lastly, for the items within the lesson-topic-buttons, I used 12 rows with 2px gutter to align the text and status bar in the vertical center of each button. Further, 24 columns with 6px gutter and 34px margin were used to align the items horizontally.

## Typography Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
For typography, I wanted a look that is fun yet professional. First, I tried using the Quicksand font because it has a young, fun appearance with the rounded corners and different boldness options. Second, I tested the Spectral font, which had a much more professional feel. After these two tests, I felt that Quicksand appeared slightly too disorganized/unprofessional, and Spectral appeared too formal. I researched more fonts through Google Fonts, and found that Roboto Slab was a happy medium of these two fonts. Using Roboto Slab for every text item on the application was a bit much, so I mixed in Roboto for subtitles, and used Playfair Display for the main app title. My final topography is shown at the very right in the image above. Details for these fonts are below.

| Text | Typeface | Font Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main Title (H1) | Playfair Display | 54px | Bold |
| Lesson Title (H2) | Roboto Slab | 34px | Regular |
| Lesson Subtitle (H3) | Roboto | 20px | Light Italic |
| Button Label (H4) | Roboto Slab | 24px | Regular |
| Status Percent (H6) | Roboto | 11px | Light |

## Button Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
I tested three button variations: rectangle with slightly rounded corners, rectangle with one circular corner, and rectangle with fully rounded corners. While I thought that the one circular corner option was unique, I felt that it had too much movement in the design. I decided to go with the slightly rounded corner option, because the buttons appeared more stable and stationary. This stationary look is what I feel goes best with learning-topic-buttons. Details for this design are below:

| Width | Height | Padding | Radius |
|---|---|---|---|
| 322px | 104px | 8px (left, right) | 12px |

## Chat Icon Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
I accessed these chat icons from [Icons8.com](https://icons8.com/). However, if I had more time on this part of my project, I would have designed each icon by hand. These were the top four chat icons I liked from the site. I tested two round chat shapes, one rectangular chat shape, and one multi-chat icon. When testing these icons, I felt that the circule shape was too tall and looked unprofessional. I appreciated the rectangular icon, but it appeared slightly too square for the overall look. Thus, I decided to use the ovular chat shape because it has less height, but still has roundness. This is seen in the second frame in the image above. The icon image measures 36px by 27px.

## Additional Detailing

### Decision Process and Design Details
As I continued to look at my design, I felt it needed a more clear grouping of elements. Based on [Gestalt Theory](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#composition), both implicit containment and explicit containment could help improve the design's visual grouping. I decided to create a unique  shape to add movement and create explicit containment around the top section of the screen. I then utilized my original grid layout to ensure that the elements were still spaced correctly. Lastly, I added a drop-shadow to the buttons and rounded the corners of the status bars (2px). The final design is shown in the rightmost frame in the image above.

## Color Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
I tested several different color variations. Six are shown above. To help me decide the color schemes, I used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) for color combinations and [Visme](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/) for further inspiration. I tested Analagous, Complementary, Monochromatic, and Primary color combinations. Different shades and hues were used to color the individual components of the design. I researched more about color psychology, specifically for [color in branding](https://www.ignytebrands.com/the-psychology-of-color-in-branding/#3), and found that blue and purple hues are what I would like to use for my music learning app. Blue instills a sense of dependability, logic, serenity, and security. Whereas purple instills a sense of wisdom, imagination, and sophistication. I decided to test more variations of the monochromatic indigo design in the bottom left frame shown above.

## Monochromatic Indigo Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
To further test the color variations, I used a [Preference Test](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/preference-testing) to see which design was most appealing to users. The feedback I got from this test is as follows:

| Screen 1 | Screen 2 | Screen 3 |
|---|---|---|
| "The title looks a little too dark" | "It's too purple for me" | "The icons at the bottom are hard to see" |
| "I can't see the button labels very well" | "The menu icon is hard to see" | "I like this bluer color more" |
| "I don't like how the buttons are darker than the background" | "I like the buttons' contrast with the background" | "The buttons really stand out here" |

Overall, participants preferred Screen 3, with the minor issue that the bottom buttons were difficult to see. The title text has great contrast with the background design, making it stand out. The button labels stand out clearly against the light button color. And the menu and chat icons are a brighter color so they do not get lost in the dark background. I made some small changes to lighten the bottom bar, and my final color design is shown below (in light and dark mode).

## Impression Test
According to Yale University's [usability site](https://usability.yale.edu/usability-testing/impression-testing), two popular ways for impression testing are picking adjectives, and the five-second test. I decided to conduct both these tests with separate samples of participants. I made the Picking-Adjectives test through Google Forms, and sent the test to 50 undergraduate students at UCLA (sent via groupme). I made the Five-Second Test through Usability Hub, and sent this test to 20 friends and family living in Orange County (sent via iMessage). I felt that my close friends/family should take the Five-Second Test rather than the Adjectives test to reduce bias. The students participating in the Adjectives test were past classmates who I have never met in person. 12 responses were submitted for the Five-Second Test, and 36 responses were submitted for the Picking-Adjectives Test. Results are below:
